# Demo

This demo shows the sales intelligence service scoring an account with a fitted
logistic regression (see `models/artifacts/model_card.md`), returning a
propensity segment, exposing metrics, and writing an audit event. `GET /health`
reports which model is loaded and that its training data was synthetic.

## Run Locally

Terminal 1:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn api.server:app --reload --port 8000
```

Terminal 2:

```bash
python scripts/smoke_test.py
```

To demo protected endpoints, start with an API key:

```bash
API_KEY=demo-key uvicorn api.server:app --reload --port 8000
```

## Curl Walkthrough

Root:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/
```

Health:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

Metrics:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/metrics
```

Score account:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/score \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @examples/requests/score.json
```

Events when `API_KEY` is set:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/events \
  -H "X-API-Key: demo-key"
```

Protected score when `API_KEY` is set:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/score \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: demo-key" \
  -d @examples/requests/score.json
```
